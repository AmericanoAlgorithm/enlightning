Simulation software for numerically solving the Navier-Stokes equations using a Runge-Kutta method for the time derivative and a hybrid WENO and DRP scheme for the space derivative. This software was specifically developed to simulate the numerical acoustical propagation of thunder using the SAMRAI adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) library developed by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Although it had/has a specific purpose for my research, it can also be used for simulating general nonlinear acoustics problems using very efficient AMR techniques and runs on top of MPI making it very scalable to massively parallel machines.
